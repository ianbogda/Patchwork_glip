Patchwork glip
==============

This lib is an OOP interface for [Patchwork][1].

It uses code from [glip][2] to provide an OOP interface for working with git repositories without git.

> glip is a Git Library In PHP. It allows you to access bare git repositories from PHP scripts, even without having git installed. The project's homepage is located at (http://fimml.at/glip).
>
> The glip-devel mailing list at <glip-devel@fimml.at> is intended for both users and developers to discuss development and issues with the library. The mailing list archives can be found at (http://lists.fimml.at/glip-devel/).
>
>
> glip was formerly part of eWiki, a wiki software written in PHP using git as version control backend. You can get more information on eWiki from (http://fimml.at/ewiki).
>
> glip was split off eWiki on May 31, 2009. An attempt was made to preserve commit history by using git filter-branch; this also means that commit messages before May 31, 2009 may seem weird (esp. wrt file names).
